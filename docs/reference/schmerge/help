usage: schmerge [-h] -s SCHEDULE -i INPUT -o OUTPUT [--lint] [--schema]

This module works on a schedule file intended for reservoir simulation(e.g.
eclipse or flow), and injects templates at given dates. If the reportdate does
not exist in advance it will be added as an independent step. The templates
will further be filled in with the given parameter values.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --lint                Lints all given input (file) arguments with no data
                        transformation.
  --schema              Output schema(s) for file parameter(s)

required named arguments:
  -s SCHEDULE, --schedule SCHEDULE
                        Schedule file to inject templates into. The only
                        currently accepted date format is the following: one
                        line consisting of the DATES keyword, followed by a
                        date in the format of '1 JAN 2000' terminated by a
                        slash. The final line consists of a slash. An empty
                        line should be in between the date format and anything
                        below.
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Json file that specifies which templates to inject
                        where.The file is structured as a list of
                        dictionaries, each containing information regarding
                        one well. The name defines the name of the well, and
                        the ops is a list of operations to be performed on the
                        well. The operations are defined within a dict with
                        the required keys template, date and any parameter
                        values that are to be injected into the given template
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        File path to write the resulting schedule file to.
