                   [--duration-constraints DURATION_CONSTRAINTS]

A module that given a list of boundaries and well constraints creates a list
of well events. Varying phase, rate and time of each event is supported. Rate
and duration boundaries are given as min/max, and phase as a list of
possibilities to choose from. Also support constants if boundaries are
replaced by value.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --lint                Lints all given input (file) arguments with no data
                        transformation.
  --schemas             Output all file schemas that are taken as input
                        parameters.
  --rate-constraints RATE_CONSTRAINTS, -rc RATE_CONSTRAINTS
                        Rate constraints file in json format, from controls
                        section of Everest config, must be indexed format.
                        Values must be in the interval [0, 1], where 0
                        corresponds to the minimum possible rate value of the
                        well the given index and 1 corresponds to the maximum
                        possible value of the well at the given index.
  --phase-constraints PHASE_CONSTRAINTS, -pc PHASE_CONSTRAINTS
                        Phase constraints file in json format, from controls
                        section of Everest config, must be indexed format.
                        Values must be in the interval [0,1], i.e in a two
                        phase case ["water", "gas"], any control value in the
                        interval [0, 0.5] will be attributed to "water" and
                        any control value in the interval (0.5, 1] will be
                        attributed to "gas".
  --duration-constraints DURATION_CONSTRAINTS, -dc DURATION_CONSTRAINTS
                        Duration constraints file in json format, from
                        controls section of Everest config, must be indexed
                        format. Values must be in the interval [0, 1], where 0
                        corresponds to the minimum possible drill time for
                        well, if given, 1 corresponds to the maximum drill
                        time of the well if given.

required named arguments:
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        File in json format containing well names and well
                        opening times, should be specified in Everest config
                        (wells.json).
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Name of the output file. The format will be yaml.
  --config CONFIG, -c CONFIG
                        Configuration file in yaml format with names, events
                        and boundaries for constraints
